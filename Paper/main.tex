\section{Conclusion}
Modern quantitative finance funds, for obvious reasons, do not disclose the methods they use in trading. However, given the extensive amount of research being 
done on applying biologically-inspired techniques, such as neural networks and evolutionary algorithms to financial problmes, it is safe to assume some of the 
methods discussed in this report are being used to make large sums of money on the worlds stock markets. The papers that we have looked at in this report have shown how using neural networks in trading has outperformed other, more traditional statistical 
techniques. By employing these models, investors can continually make profits that outperform the market, at the expense of the technical knowledge required to employ them.\\

As more research goes into improving the efficiency and predictive power of these techniques, they will only continue to help investors make bigger and 
more consistent profits. However, the stock market also allows a great playground for building models that can be used in other fields. This could, for example,
be applied to predicting rainfall based on past time-series data, or how populations of animals will change over time. \\
