\section{Improvements to Automated Trading}

Neural networks have to be trained on a portfolio of assets. But selecting the optimal portfolio to use trading methods on is a problem in itself. 
In \cite{adewumi}, the authors used a total of six heuristic and metaheuristic techniques in finding an optimal portfolio. They found a Sawtooth Genetic Algorithm 
is the fastest computationally, and therefore provides a more efficient improvement over a standard genetic algorithm. \\

One of the main ways of improvement in the past is using global search algorithms, focussing on improving the values of the weights in the neural 
network. Or similarly, imprving the algorithms for training the networks. One big improvement, relevant to this module in particular, is \cite{kim}.  In this paper, the authors use a genetic algorithm to search for the optimal 
set of weights in the netowrk. The authors compare three models for determining weights in the network. The genetic algorithm approach they use for 
reducing the dimensionality of data has a $10-11\%$ higher prediction accuracy. Reducing the dimensionality is a great way to make improvements,
since market data is very complex and dense, so searching it for key features using conventional methods is not an easy task. \\

Combining the evolutionary technique for portfolio selection with the neural network method for automatic trading could lead to a very powerful 
investment stratergy.
